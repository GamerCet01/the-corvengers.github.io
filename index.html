        <p>This project is just easy. Im not going to be working that hard on this. I opened paint and had nothing to do so this is what i did. And I thought it would be a great idea to publish this as a knockoff of Marvel: Avengers Infinity War</center</p>
        <p>I only made the sketch because that looks too good and gives us satisfaction. I don't even know what I have written in this one.</p>
        <p>One day, I decided to have some fun with my paints and canvas. I thought, why not create a painting</p>
        <p> So, I painted my own version called "The Convengers." It was a playful mix of characters, and honestly, I was just goofing around.</p>
        <p>Actually i just used AI to do literally everything except the picture.</p>
        <p>I don't know why but i named it "The Corvengers".</p>
        <p>This looks similar to Infinity War to me so I name it Infinity Kar.</p>
        <p>Why Kar? I don't want to be sued by Marvel that's why lol.</p>

        <p>This is the Main Character.</p>
        <p>I gathered some of my friends and searched for his name. We wanted his name to be unique and simple.</p>
        <p>The name of the species that you see here is, Flork. And Dork represents a smart Flork.</p>
        <p>Dork is a small nerd who is innocent in the start of the story
        and he becomes powerful as the story continues. He ain't got any superpowers too.</p>
